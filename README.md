# Predict-the-star-rating-of-restaurants-based-on-Customer-reviews
 In this project, I used the SPSS modeler to extract keywords from customer reviews and determine the sentiments of certain attributes such as Food, Atmosphere, service, price etc. Then created the rules for these categories based on combination of words from these categories and deducing overall sentiment. Then I used these rules to generate associations models between rules and the star rating provided to the restaurants. The models used were Apriori, Association rule, C5.0 (a rule set or tree generating model)
